# Door-Unlocker-Project

This is one of my builds using a Raspberry Pi, completed over the first couple of months of 2017 while learning python and how to use the raspberry pi.

	The Door unlocker is setup so that when a person taps an access card on the RFID reader, the mechanism will unlock the door and allow the person to enter.<br><br>
	To prevent unauthorized personnel from entering, after leaving the door unlocked for 5 seconds, the mechanism will once again trigger, lock the door, and light up the blue LED to indicate that the RFID reader is ready to detect access cards. <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br>
